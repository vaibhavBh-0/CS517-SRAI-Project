The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail. \\n\\nIn March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four-year project of digitising its collection of manuscripts, to be made available online. \\n\\nThe Vatican Secret Archives were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century; they contain another 150,000 items. \\n\\nScholars have traditionally divided the history of the library into five periods, Pre-Lateran, Lateran, Avignon, Pre-Vatican and Vatican. \\n\\nThe Pre-Lateran period, comprising the initial days of the library, dated from the earliest days of the Church.

He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. \\n\\nAfter ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \\n\\nIn 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets. They had been taken home by a production company employee and given to her children after filming was completed. \\n\\n\"In 2005, the nephew of the original rescuer found the puppets in a family attic and brought them to be appraised on the PBS series \\'Antiques Roadshow,\\' \" the Times said. \"Created for about $5,000 each in 1964, they were valued at $8,000 to $10,000 for the pair.
